# Video Scene Summarizer

## Overview

The **Video Scene Summarizer** project is designed to automatically generate a summary of videos by detecting significant scenes. The tool processes the video content, detects scene changes, and creates a concise summary that highlights the key moments. This project is particularly useful for video editing, content creation, and analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Scene Detection**: Automatically detects and identifies key scene changes within a video.
- **Video Summarization**: Creates a shorter video that highlights the most important scenes.
- **Metadata Generation**: Generates metadata for the summarized video, such as key scene timestamps.
- **Visualization**: Optionally, generates a visual timeline of the video’s scene changes.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/farimahJl/VideoSceneSummarizer.git
   cd VideoSceneSummarizer
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install OpenCV** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python-headless
   ```

5. **Install TQDM** (for progress bars):
   ```bash
   pip install tqdm
   ```

6. **Install Matplotlib** (for visualizations):
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

Run the **Video Scene Summarizer** tool using the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input <path_to_video_file> --output <path_to_output_file> --metadata --visualize
```

### Command Line Options:
- `--input`: The path to the input video file.
- `--output`: The path to save the summarized video.
- `--metadata`: Optional flag to generate metadata for the summarized video.
- `--visualize`: Optional flag to generate a timeline visualization of the scenes.

### Example:

```bash
python main.py --input data/example.mpeg --output outputs/summary_videos/summary.mp4 --metadata --visualize
```

## How It Works

The **Video Scene Summarizer** operates in several key stages:

1. **Scene Detection**: The tool analyzes the video frame by frame to detect sharp changes in the video, indicating scene transitions.
2. **Scene Selection**: Based on detected scene changes, the most significant scenes are selected.
3. **Video Summarization**: The selected scenes are combined to create a shortened version of the video.
4. **Visualization** (Optional): A timeline visualization shows where the detected scenes occur in the video.

## Conclusion

The **Video Scene Summarizer** is a useful tool for automatically generating summarized versions of videos, providing an efficient way to extract key moments without watching the entire content. The project can be applied to various fields, such as content creation, media analysis, and video editing.

## Future Improvements

1. **Improved Scene Detection Algorithms**: Implement more advanced techniques for more accurate scene detection.
2. **Audio Summarization**: Incorporate audio analysis to identify key moments in the audio track, such as speech or sound events.
3. **Support for More Formats**: Extend support to more video formats beyond the basic ones.
4. **Interactive Visualizations**: Improve the visualization tool for a better user experience.
