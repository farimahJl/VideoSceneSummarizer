Video Scene Summarizer
Project Overview
The Video Scene Summarizer is an intelligent tool designed to automatically generate concise video summaries by detecting key scenes in a video. The project utilizes computer vision techniques to identify important scenes, extract them, and compile them into a shortened video. This project can be applied to a variety of use cases, including summarizing long video content, generating highlights from movies, documentaries, or personal videos.

The tool allows users to visualize the timeline of scenes and optionally include metadata, offering flexibility in customization. The project aims to reduce the time spent watching large video files while retaining important information from them.

Features
Scene Detection: Identifies and extracts key scenes from a video using computer vision.

Video Summarization: Compiles the detected scenes into a shortened video summary.

Metadata Support: Generates and optionally includes metadata in the summary.

Visualization: Visualizes the timeline of video scenes.

Flexible Input & Output: Accepts videos in various formats and generates outputs in MP4 format.

Installation Instructions
To set up and use the Video Scene Summarizer, follow the instructions below:

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher

Git (optional, for version control)

A text editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/farimahJl/VideoSceneSummarizer.git
cd VideoSceneSummarizer
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Once inside the project folder, install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can manually install the required libraries like:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python-headless tqdm matplotlib
Step 3: Setup and Configuration
Make sure the necessary input files (such as the video you want to summarize) are placed in the correct directory. You can specify paths to the input and output files in the terminal when running the program.

Usage
Running the Program
To run the program, use the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py --input path/to/your/video.mpeg --output path/to/summary/output.mp4 --metadata --visualize
Here’s what each option does:

--input: Path to the input video file.

--output: Path where the summarized video will be saved.

--metadata: Optionally includes metadata in the summary.

--visualize: Visualizes the timeline of detected scenes.

Example
For example, if you have a video file named example.mpeg and want to generate a summarized version of it, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py --input data/example.mpeg --output outputs/summary.mp4 --metadata --visualize
